# Echoes

Echoes is a digital memory and emotion archive designed to preserve the moments
that shape us — the ones that lifted our hearts and the ones that quietly broke
them too.

It is a personal space to store memories that made you feel seen, moments that
told you that you are not alone, and experiences that stayed with you long after
they passed.

## Why Echoes?
Life moves fast, and emotions often fade into the noise of everyday routine.
Echoes exists to slow things down.

It helps users capture meaningful moments — both joyful and difficult — and
organize them with emotional context, allowing reflection, understanding, and
self-growth over time.

This is not just a diary.  
It is a structured archive of human experiences.
